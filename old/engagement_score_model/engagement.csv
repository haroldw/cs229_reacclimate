you reasoning is unfounded and indicates that you do not understand how nonlinear regression works venus is the extreme end point of a highly nonlinear pressuretemperature continuum excluding venus from the regression makes the continuum undefined at that extreme simple,1.0,1.0
organised agriculture evolved whenwas warmer than today but had at long last reached the minimum required 240ppm of atmospheric co,1.0,1.0
you have not answered my question about the source of the net increase anthropogenic or natural,1.0,1.0
yes but that is not related to the problem of wanting to say that theories are positively true it is a technical problem to do with the definition of a probability that is the real problem with pvalues,1.0,1.0
if they did co2 levels would be at the same sort of level that they were in previous interglacials that were about as warm as it is today we have added a new branch to the carbon cycle that directly connects the lithosphere and the atmosphere thus there is a new way 3/n,1.0,1.0
thanks for your objective response i have seen similar elanations to those in the video link take a look at this which draws a similar conclusion slides and to salby ie temperature ahead of co2 thoughts,1.0,1.0
you are aware of metaphors,1.0,1.0
effect diminishes with concentration,1.0,1.0
do you think children are getting the correct messages on climate change,1.0,1.0
avoiding dragging others into a pointless discussion the numbers below are not quite right but it is true that co2 is not the dominant radiative influence in the greenhouse effect however it is the dominant nonprecipitating greenhouse gas and hence places a key role,2.0,1.0
ignore history at your own peril since when have humans learned from history there is plenty of evidence supporting that co2 has never driven temps,1.0,1.0
so why are you not listening history proved that co2 does not drive temp simple fact,1.0,1.0
trying to get me to make hyperbolic statements example,1.0,1.0
no it was caused by volcanic dust and so2 that blocked out the sun killing plants the acid rain wiped out marine life too co2 increase was from cessation of uptake from plant death and low photosynthesis while bacteria lived on plant remains,1.0,1.0
the data from the instrumental period has been homogenized and pasteurized a lot of more than is done for milk and they use proxy data in nuclear physics for example c14 is a proxy for age o16/18 is a proxy for temp they have some use co2 in ice cores and tree rings,1.0,1.0
do not you have to have a firm understanding of the population before you can eress probabilities so you are comfortable with stretching your neck out about probabilities based on second and third hand information ie proxydata and that is scientific,1.0,1.0
paper on it is one of these you can find it,1.0,1.0
which is why earth burned up mya when global was ~25c w/ co2 over ~1000 oh wait,1.0,1.0

you want to stick with the story it is not the sun output and variations of earth motion around it and around it is own center of mass etc that are responsible for earths climate lol and you think us adding lt trace gas co2 in the atmosphere is responsible loltillhurts,1.0,1.0

there are plenty that have no need to claim to be eerts because they quite obviously are eg there are plenty of skeptics who seem to have the monumental hubris to think they know better than the scientists because of what they have read on blogs,1.0,1.0
no his conclusion was that at least some of the change in co2 is natural his analysis showed a correlation between two variable such that one could elain the change in the other he did not say it did elain you clearly do not understand how science works,1.0,1.0
so you are unaware of research showing that co2 changes in response to enso cycles hard for me to take you seriously when you have no idea that the rate of co2 from natural processes vary,1.0,1.0
i recently met with a group of over 80s and asked them if they could honestly say whether the uk climate had changed during their lifetimes they all said no however a couple of them mentioned as being the most extreme weather they had ever eerienced,1.0,1.0
the effect of co2 is logarithmic so it takes much more of an increase to get the same effect wild claims like a increase are impossible from eected rises in co2 levels learn the science and stop with the fear mongering,1.0,1.0
who denies climate perhaps deny that the small contribution mankind has to the co2 cycle of the earth will lead to an existential threat to humanity,1.0,1.0
all the evidence points to warmer waters melting arctic ice not warmer air temps the warmer air temps are a side effect from the warm water which is from ocean cycles not co2 warm air cools quickly to the very cold sky as long as it is not cloudy,1.0,1.0
apparently ad homs are okay when it suits presumably,1.0,1.0
no because the air is cooling to space up to the limit dew point imposes on cooling at night but a warmer surface cools more than a cold surface water cools more than ice and incident angle limits the possibility of a tipping point it is not to say it is warmer or not,1.0,1.0
latent heat also called insensible does not warm the air,1.0,1.0
