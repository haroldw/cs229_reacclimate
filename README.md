CS229 Class Project

To dos before Wednesday Week 6: 

- [ ] PRAW
  - [ ] Create notebook
  - [ ] Shows attributes we have access to
  - [ ] Sizes of datasets
  - [ ] What limitations do we have on data access etc.
- [ ] NLTK
  - [ ] Create notebook
  - [ ] What can we do with the sentiment analysis API?
- [ ] Literature review 
  - [ ] Read previous papers to have a sense of what has already been done
  - [ ] Create Overleaf document
